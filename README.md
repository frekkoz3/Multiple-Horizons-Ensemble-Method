## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop **MHEMe (Multiple Horizons Ensemble Method)**, a novel ensemble approach for **time series forecasting** aimed at reducing prediction variance.

The method combines forecasts generated at multiple prediction horizons into a single ensemble prediction, leveraging horizon diversity to improve stability and robustness.

## Repository Structure

```bash
├─ data             # data used for evaluation of the method
├─ experiments      # folder containing different tests
├─ report           # documentation of the final report
├─ literautre       # folder containing literature research about the project
└─ src              # method's Python implementation
```

## Results

The proposed method is evaluated on standard time series datasets and compared against baseline forecasting models in terms of variance and predictive accuracy.
